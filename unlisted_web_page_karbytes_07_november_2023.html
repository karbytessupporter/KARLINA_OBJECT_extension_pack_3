In order for one person to have nice things, some other person has to be deprived of those nice things.

P: "Of course people are trying to make Karlina have a nervous breakdown in public as a means to eject Karlina from the public sphere. We expect Karlina to have to be institutionalized for acting out in ways which are deemed to be threatening to public safety or to Kar's own safety. We do not think it is good for Kar to be so intensely devoted to some project. We want Karlina to be prevented from doing anything physically or intellectually challenging so that Kar conforms to what the public seems to prefer Karlina to be: too uptight to do anything but take offense and engage in self sabotage for the public's amusement and to punish Karlina for offending us."

Q: "Why would karbytes engage in self sabotage as a result of not being allowed by people other than karbytes to take on endeavors which those people think are physically or intellectually challenging?"

P: "Karlina engaging in such endeavors would eventually give her a sense of accomplishment and hence a sense of feeling good, in control, and making progress towards something of value. We think Karlina has committed too many unforgivable transgressions and has a personality no one except for Karlina seems to condone taking residence in the world for us to want to allow to have self esteem, freedom, competence, and being liked and supported in being successful and happy by other people. Instead, we want Karlina to think that no one except for Karlina wants Karlina to attain those niceties. Such things are not unconditional rights. Instead, they are privileges which can be revoked as a consequence of committing some unforgivable transgression. We do not like the character Karlina is trying to portray herself as to herself and others and want her to be coerced into embodying a character which is much more histrionic, humorless, irritable, wounded, panicky, and deeply dissatisfied."
