I can empirically deduce that something exists in my subjective experience.

I can logically induce that events occurred in exactly one chronological order between some date in what I conceptualize and refer to as "the past" to the moment along that past's encompassing space-time interval which I conceptualize and refer to as "the present moment".

Due to the fact that, by definition,  subjective experience only occurs for its experiencer in what that experiencer experiences as "the present moment", it is logically true that it is impossible for that experiencer to verify that the chronological order of events which that experiencer reconstructs from "memory" bares any resemblance to what actually transpired from nature's perspective.

If nature (or anything) is omniscient, then that omniscient thing cannot learn anything new (by logical definition).

karbytes is not necessarily omniscient. 

karbytes claims to be non omniscient.

karbytes also claims that the target audience of its blogs is "future and parallel karbytes".

karbytes claims that "future karbytes" and "parallel karbytes" are all parallel universe versions of the karbytes writing (and perhaps reading) this note NOW.

"I have an infinitely long lifespan starting from the moment I was born" (as declared by karbytes) is impossible for karbytes to prove either conclusively true or else conclusively false. (The statement describes a logically binary set of conditions to which there are zero alternatives).
