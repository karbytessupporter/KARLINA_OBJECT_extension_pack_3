Currently, I strongly prefer detaining and forcibly sterilizing all humans aged 12 years and older (through tube tying surgeries (which are surgically reversible)) and then allowing only those members of that population who satisfy strict prerequisites to have that sterilization surgery reversed (and only for up to two pregnancies per womb). (1/3)

I also strongly prefer that some humans be cloned from stem cells whose DNA was modified in order to cause the resulting humans to not develop functional gametes such that those humans end up being permanently sterile and then having those humans raised in state run boarding schools until those humans reach adulthood and then are transitioned to living in economy housing units while subsisting on a universal basic income with the option to earn additional income through contract jobs. (2/3)

* * *

As long as the total human population remains within a comfortable range, each of those humans lifespans could be extended for indefinitely long periods by replacing damaged body parts with lab-grown replacement parts which are derived from a patient's own stem cells. (3/3)

The three tweets displayed above this sentence in this file were deleted within 24 hours after the event of each of those three tweets being published on karbytes' Twitter and Minds social media web pages.

karbytes almost wanted to tweet the following paragraph but decided not to: 

<span style="background:#ffff00">Why is "cruelty-free meat" (i.e. meat which is produced from animal stem cells being cultivated in laboratories without harming the animal host of those stem cells) not available (and the predominant meat option) throughout all first world nations at this time?</span>

I am grateful to being born as a result mutually consenting human parents through sexual reproduction (or that is what I prefer to believe so as to not feel disturbed by having arrived here as a result of slavery, torture, rape, and other forms of extreme suffering which my ancestors "had to(?)" go through in order to allow me (i.e. karbytes) to exist). It is a privilege to be invested in by people who wanted me to be here and who continue to this day (or that is what I prefer to believe for the sake of feeling good and productive and (politically) powerful).

I was thinking that "factory farmed" (i.e. lab-grown instead of produced through sexual reproduction) humans might be happier than those who are born as a result of sexual reproduction. That is because I think that the lab-grown variety would each be treated as municipally planned-for human individuals who are here to help build, test, and refine the user experience of being human. There will always be a need for humans in various jobs which keep human civilization's infrastructure in tact and improving (and so also will be the constant "threat" (i.e. "adverse" possibility) that something detrimental to human individuals' goals will occur (which means there will presumably always be problems for humans to solve and challenges to overcome)).
