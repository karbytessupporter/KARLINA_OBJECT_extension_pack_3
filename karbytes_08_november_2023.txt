As of 08_NOVEMBER_2023, karbytes is tentatively planning on doing the following:

(0) after finalizing this year's M_DISC collection and their respective binders full of paper printouts of web pages from Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com, karbytes is also making a copy of that content onto approximately six M_DISCs (because the entire collection of digital files presumably will not fit onto one M_DISC (and a single M_DISC has a maximum data storage capacity of approximately 4.7 gigabytes)), putting those six M_DISCs into a metal safe, putting that safe at the bottom of a hole karbytes dug which is more than three feet deep, and filling the hole with sand (and perhaps covering the top with dirt and dried grass so that the hole does not appear to exist). Many years later karbytes might dig it up, test the M_DISCs in a DVD player hooked up to a laptop computer, and then put the M_DISCs back in the hole beneath a pillar of sand beneath a decorative film of dirt and dried grass.

(1) as an elaborate philosophical exercise, drive to Yosemite, hike to a ledge which is high enough above the bottom of Yosemite Valley, and video record myself standing there saying that I could end my life within the next 60 seconds if I decided to take a tumble from that height. Then drive home and make another one of those videos. Upload those videos to GitHub and maybe also to Instagram (and update the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com accordingly).

One goal which I am always striving towards and (seemingly) never completing is proving that I, karbytes, am immortal.

Another goal which I am always striving towards is appointing myself to be my highest authority (as an information processing agent with the (apparent) ability to manipulate objects when and how I want to (within some deterministic constraints)).
