Today karbytes' purchased a smaller backpack that what karbytes has been using almost daily for the past few months so that karbytes can have extra clothes, water, and a power bank and USB-C to USB 3.1 charging cable to charge karbytes' phone, and any other small items which karbytes might want to have on its person immediately while commuting to and from karbytes' new job at an Amazon warehouse in Fremont, California (via bicycling and using the BART train system) while leaving the larger backpack in the (100% gasoline powered) Toyota Matrix minivan which karbytes' parents have allowed karbytes to borrow and which karbytes intends to keep mostly parked at wherever karbytes' home or "home away from home" camping spot is located so as to (a) minimize wear and tear on the vehicle, (b) minimize gasoline combustion, (c) minimize funding of the fossil fuels monopolistic industry, and (d) to maximize karbytes' self esteem and pleasure (and karbytes derives such things from honoring karbytes' values (which include environmental sustainability and respect for biodiversity as well as personal freedom, personal autonomy, and physical fitness).

(For the record, I had a nice ten minute chat on the phone today with my mom who called me earlier today. I would say that I am on good terms with my parents and I expect that trend to continue. I intend to do the best I can to be on good terms with every person (which means that I might need to avoid contact with some persons)).

Not pictured in the image named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_3/main/karbytes_sustainable_commute_mode_11_november_2023.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes_sustainable_commute_mode_11_november_2023.jpg</a> is karbytes' Hewlett-Packard (Linux operating system) laptop computer and accompanying charger (which can both fit in the backpack but perhaps at the expense of some of the clothing items), karbytes' Samsung (Android operating system) phone (which karbytes always intends to travel with), karbytes' wallet and keys (which karbytes also always intends to travel with), some non perishable food items, and perhaps some space blankets.

In the picture named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_3/main/amazon_training_dates_and_seasonal_job_information_10_november_2023.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amazon_training_dates_and_seasonal_job_information_10_november_2023.png</a> is information about my first three days of work at my new job. I am not sure what my schedule will look like after those initial three days because my working hours are said to be variable but supposedly no fewer than 30 hours per week. (Also, based on some posts I have read on <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit</a>, my job (being "seasonal" rather than "permanent"), is expected to last between 3 and 11 months (and I might be able to transition to a full-time position if my performance is exceptionally good).

I have recently (within the past two days) started to think of all jobs which I apply for and do as "seasonal" instead of "permanent" because doing so makes me feel less married and more single and, as a consequence, makes me also feel less depressed and more optimistic and happy about my future because I (presumably) have the freedom to travel to different parts of the world as a contract employee instead of a long-term committed to one department for "too many years" consecutively.

<span style="background:#ffff00">Ultimately I expect the generations of humans after mine (i.e. the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Millennials</a>) to transform the socioeconomic landscape to exude more modern and humane sensibilities such as issuing every person a minimum <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basic income</a>, automating most if not all jobs which are dangerous for humans and not as cost effective if deploying humans instead of robots, and generally be more educated and hence more tolerant of people who are different from them. I expect fossil fuels to be completely phased out before the end of my lifespan (though I am hoping to also live long enough to be granted access to technologies and living conditions which enable me to extend my lifespan and faculties for a period of <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/count_down_timer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a> which approaches infinity in terms of temporal length).</span>
