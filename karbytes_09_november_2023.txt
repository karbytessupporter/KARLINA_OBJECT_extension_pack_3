A pattern I have noticed become especially prominent in my experience during the past three months is other humans within a quarter mile radius of me slamming down their car horns (often for more than five seconds per single honk and honking multiple times within an interval lasting between 30 seconds and ten minutes), yelling profanities which seem to be exclusively targeted at me, and otherwise getting close to where I am sitting to talk (apparently in order to insult me, distract me, and provoke me into reacting to their presence in ways which undermine my intellectual and moral credibility) seemingly in order to passive aggressively communicate that such people disapprove of me having space, time, and material resources to pursue activities and even mere trains of thought which do not involve other people, which do not appear to infringe upon other people's business, and which increase my sense of well-being and satisfaction with my life. Out of jealousy and fear of social nonconformists, many other humans very often seem to have nothing better to do in their free time other than try to prevent me from thriving as well as I believe I easily could by my own efforts (especially if those bullies did not bully me).

I think those people are cucks to a worldview and culture which is seemingly incompatible with mine (and because such people greatly outnumber me and seem to have more socioeconomic power than what I have as a lone individualist), I always default to the losing position and usually pack up and leave the premises despite not being done with what I was working on. (Such people seem to stalk me and bully me in the manner I described even when I go home. Hence, I know from ample experience that going home is not an escape from such meddling. In fact, it is generally worse for me at home than it is for me outside of Castro Valley as a vagrant because the Wi-Fi at my house is rigged against me to the extent that it is unsuitable for any kind of remote work or online schooling. I think there is a large scale militaristic agenda being implemented in order to prevent me from attaining the kind of lifestyle I want despite that lifestyle hardly costing any money in comparison to what most people's lifestyles seem to demand even to the extent that I am prevented by others from having even a part time seasonal job. I think what "The People" want is to "break" me so that I settle for identifying as having a disability such as autism and having no income other than donations from family members and disability payments from the government while being forced to live with my parents until they are too old to live outside of some nursing facility so that I am forced to be what "The People" want me to be: merely my parents' caregiver while missing out on having a career, advanced educational opportunities, travel opportunities, the experience of living on my own in my own apartment, having friends who are passionate and competent at the subjects I want to be passionate and competent at, and even being physically and mentally fit).

"The People" are attention whores who demand to keep burning fossil fuels instead of switching to pollution free energy production, incarcerating and/or slaughtering sentient animals in order to consume their flesh, milk, and eggs (instead of promoting plant based or cultured animal cell options), not allowing me to decompress after being stressed out by interrupting me and bullying me as soon as I show signs of wanting to practice deep breathing or some other stress reduction exercise (because such people think I deserve to be too stressed out to think clearly because such people are desperate to undermine my attractive and adaptive qualities so that I look worse than them), and literally acting desperate to deprive me of privacy and distance away from them.

I have been reluctant to tell the public via my blogging platform that I have been offered a seasonal warehouse job within the past week because I am afraid "The People" are desperate to keep me from attaining and keeping employment. They seem to think I already have "too much" money just for being very frugal and strategic about how I spend my time and money. Hence, I fear they would resort to (and get away with) draining gasoline out of my car's gasoline tank when I am not looking, stealing my mail, hacking into my cloud based accounts in order to censor me or to prevent me from accessing funds, harassing me when I am trying to sleep between work shifts so that I become too dangerously worn out to function as well as I ought to (and so that I am more likely to be fired from my job or to "rage quit" my job). It seems that "The People" are not comfortable with me being as cool, smart, kind, active, and fun as I really want to be and feel I naturally am. Instead, what "The People" want is for me to be chronically miserable, irate, distracted, incoherent, inarticulate, myopic, destitute, sore, and daresay violence prone. That way, "The People" can bat their eyelashes and touch their breasts in mock surprise when I lash out as cartoonishly as they demand while they act like innocent, humble angels who do their civic duty and who are well loved by their communities which they live to serve. If I do not lash out, then they seem to lash out. They seem to always demand that I always be near them and always ready to drop whatever I'm doing to make them the center of attention.

I might not update my blogging platform for a while. If I take a break from updating that platform for longer than one week, it is to help my blogging platform's content quality improve (which is hard for me to do without a job which allows me to have enough money to seriously enjoy my projects instead of barely having enough money to merely survive while dealing with people who I think are ugly (inside and out), controlling, intellectually retarded, cowardly, conformist, chauvinistic, obnoxious, rude, and parasitic). You people have your captive spouses, dogs, and kids to fawn over you and hang on your every word like you are their authority. I'm not here to kiss your ass. I don't want you nor your weapons touching me. I will proceed by treating you vermin like belligerent drama-addicted brats incapable of evolving. I will likely say deliberately insulting things to your face instead of keeping silent and acting nonchalant because you people don't usually stop intensely picking on me until I react in a grotesque way. You people disgust me so much I feel obliged to keep any friendships I have a secret (but you people seem to stalk and interfere with me every second of every day such that you effectively police every little social interaction I have to the extent that I feel that I being prevented from mingling with the kinds of people I would actually enjoy the company of so that I only interact with people I have no desire to "hang out" with. Then you can gloat about how antisocial and unpopular and unlikable I am compared to You. The world belongs to You more than it belongs to me because of "strength in numbers" (which I meant to imply as being synonymous to "majority rule")).

At least I have nature and nonhuman animals to be entertained, comforted, and inspired by. I know You hate that.

I felt the need to say this (just to be clear with whoever is reading this web page and karbytes-generated content in general):

My biggest fear is intense physical pain (especially if it is what I deem to be gory and what I deem to be prolonged in terms of temporal duration and what I deem to be excessively frequent).
