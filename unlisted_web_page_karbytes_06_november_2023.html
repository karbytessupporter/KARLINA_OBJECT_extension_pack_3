Q: "Is <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chelsea Manning</a> a man or a woman?"

P: "A man."

Q: "Is <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes</a> a man or a woman?"

P: "A woman."

Q: "Are you opposed to karbytes taking testosterone injections?"

P: "We prefer women to not take testosterone injections because that's letting women overstep their evolutionary and cultural bounds into what has been time honored as being exclusively men's territory. Testosterone makes women like Karlina unnecessarily and unnaturally brash, ornery, and selfishly demanding instead of more inclined to remain mellow, frugal, and conscientious especially of trying to take up as little space as possible. (My advice to karbytes is to be more tight lipped and to not look so uptight so as to not make other people feel uncomfortable. If karbytes makes other people feel uncomfortable, karbytes needs to be handled by the authorities as a criminal who needs to be kept under stricter watch than everyone else, subject to harsher treatment than everyone else, and readily detained or incapacitated as the authorities and citizen justice ambassadors think is appropriate. Just shut up Kar. Your physical and mental being drowned out by the voices of others is not a national emergency and it does not inconvenience anyone but yourself. Get over yourself and stop acting like you're more deserving of a good time than everyone else. You are being prevented from having a career so that you stay at home and live on disability for autism or some other condition which makes you unemployable and/or unable to manage your own money nor living situation according to authorities (and we are under no obligation to tell you true nor complete information nor are we under any obligation to allow you access to any or all money, electronic communications, or physical mail which other people attempt to send to you. You are not even allowed to cope with poise nor peace of mind. Instead, you are only allowed to physically and mentally deteriorate (and permanently so) and to be forced against your will to look more borderline personality disordered, lazy, and impulsive than you actually are). That's so people don't get to know what a beautiful soul you think you have as punishment for inconveniencing specific individuals who you were said to have crossed the boundaries of in unforgivable ways)."

P: "All you think about is yourself, Karlina. We don't want you to get a job until you get the fuck over yourself and stop acting like you deserve more money than the rest of us. Not every day is your birthday. We're waiting for you to come down from being so high strung and self focused. Stop mowing about yourself, bitch. You're just a token Disney girl Nazi who can't handle anything without being waited on and treated like royalty. Yep. We seem to be over and done with describing you."

karbytes: "Seemingly everywhere I go someone is fuming at me and trying to get me to conclude that they want me to leave."

P: "That's because we're tired of having to pay for your ass and of putting up with you. You're not in as much demand as you think you are. We just want you to stay out of the limelight and not take up any more money than you're worth: not more than a murderous felon on death row."

karbytes: "Are you opposed to Chelsea Manning taking estrogen injections?"

P: "Absolutely. That's him shirking his duties as a man otherwise fit for being <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drafted into the military</a> as every able bodied man within a specific age range is supposed to be. The estrogen fucks up his ability to serve as part of the draft and as a man in general. It makes him less fit for his biologically and culturally ordained role."

P: "We stand over karbytes (or somewhere near karbytes) to ensure that karbytes writes in a way which would be effective for catering to the target audience (seemingly of all human existence (and otherwise)): men. If it were not for our intervention, karbytes would be much more intellectually disabled looking. You're welcome. Oh, and by the way, because you have been so heavily dependent on us for helping you write your blog, we decided that we deserve to be its sole proprietors. Hence, we decided to patent it and make it accessible only to those who we grant such access to (and you are not the necessarily one of them nor are you necessarily granted the most privileged access as an administrator to your own website)."

karbytes: "You might be lying to me. If so, you might be trying to discourage me from acting as my websites' sole proprietor."

P: "You are too attached to your stuff and too attached to your ego. Many people (especially women) think you use your mouth too much and need to be more tight-lipped and use smaller and more commonly used words and mannerisms so that you do not appear to be some kind of conniving megalomaniac scheming to take over the world while they sit in their backyards sipping camomile. Hence, we need to confiscate your privileges and strip you of your privacy so that we can control you more easily (and make you into a whimpering women with nothing to show for herself because she is forced to be a prostitute). All you have to work on is yourself, Karlina. All you need to do is take care of yourself and not be too much of a nuisance to society that you will be forced to die or go into hiding."

karbytes: "I was gonna say earlier that a woman can hardly breathe without a man's permission and that all women are hostages (given that women make up approximately half the human population yet are regarded as minorities who are disadvantaged (which makes me think women either choose to not fight for equal rights as men or else women are physically prevented from fighting for such rights)). I will wait for gender to become optional before I invest in intimate relationships with other humans."

P: "Gender polarity is an essential part of what it means to be human and the means for sustaining the human species. I do not want to hear any more crap from you about cultured meat, stem cell cloning, and artificial wombs. I do not want sexual dimorphism nor legally enforced gender polarization to go out of effect. I want people like you to be treated as delinquents and mentally ill persons deserving of lifelong incarceration and <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human trafficking</a> purposes. Hate and violence will never go out of vogue because it adds zest to a man's life. I want men to have sissies to bully. That's why I want people like you to keep existing rather than going extinct. I want people like you to be the submissive ones who get subjugated by people like me. It makes my dick hard. My hard dick is the compass which points to civilization's true north. I just want to treat you like a sex toy I can torture and abuse. I do not want to talk to you like you are just another man on my caliber of intellect and socioeconomic status."

karbytes: "Why do so many men in big pickup trucks park nearby and honk at me whenever I think and feel too intensely for them to seemingly stand?"

P: "They do not like that you are working so much harder than they are. It makes them think that there is something wrong; that you don't think they are doing enough with their time off. Hence, they would rather police you into not having all that time to work on your projects because it makes you too narcissistic for those guys to stand. They don't like feeling like you are getting more time to advance your personal endeavors than they are advancing theirs. Hence, they stand by making sure that no one gets anything done other than rudimentary survival and security oriented tasks."

karbytes: "Clearly, Karlina is not done being a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premenstrual_syndrome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PMS</a>-y femi-Nazi who is not mentally well enough nor in good enough legal and social standing to be taken seriously and to be treated as trustworthy, self-sovereign, and properly assimilated to her encompassing society. Maybe I will be fixed in a few months or years from now. Until then, I will try to keep my distance from others and to not infect anyone with my disease which is corrosive to <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronormativity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heteronormativity</a>."
