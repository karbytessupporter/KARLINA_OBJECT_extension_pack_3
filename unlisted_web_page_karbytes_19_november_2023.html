I was waiting until 19_NOVEMBER_2023 since yesterday to write a note like this one (because I did not want this note's relatively "low brow" content to detract from the slightly less "low brow" <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_18_november_2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content</a> which I published yesterday in the plain-text file named karbytes_18_november_2023.txt).

(Besides publishing the plain-text file named karbytes_19_november_2023.txt today, I also published video files named pig_gorl_19_november_2023_part_0.mp4, pig_gorl_19_november_2023_part_1.mp4, and pig_gorl_19_november_2023_part_2.mp4).

What I wanted to say in karbytes_19_november_2023.txt which I did not say in karbytes_18_november_2023.txt is the following two things:

<span style="background:#ffff00">(0) I redact what I said about men generally treating me better than women. Depending on which information is occupying the most space in my working memory at a particular moment in time, I might be inclined to reflexively conclude that (a) men are crueler to me than women are or (b) that women are crueler to me than men are or (c) that men and women are roughly equal in terms of how cruel they are to me.</span>

<span style="background:#ffff00">(1) If any person engages in ongoing behavior which is what I consider to be seriously detrimental to my quality of life for a sufficiently long time, I would not hesitate to have that person quickly killed (but only if I am sufficiently confident that my voting to have that person killed would not result in anything seriously bad happening to me as a result of people wanting to retaliate against me for exterminating a particular person).</span>

To elaborate on the first of those two things, I think I generally feel more contempt towards women than towards men because I think that women tend to default to enabling the men in their lives to get away with being tyrannical and belligerent due to those women being conditioned to assume a very passive and dumbed down role compared to their male counterparts (and I think that trend is most prominent amongst Black and Hispanic/Latino populations and probably the least prominent amongst the comparatively egalitarian and liberal (rather than culturally conservative) white (notice the lack of capitalization) populations). The <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/pig_gorl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pig_gorl recordings</a> I made are my attempts to imitate the vocal qualities I find most abhorrent about culturally conservative and/or under-educated women. They sound like cucks to the patriarchy who normalize being weaker, stupider, and less vibrant than they otherwise could be despite comprising approximately half the human population and having the same legal rights as men. Despite the fact that women are treated as having equal rights as men by law, the vast majority of women (and pretty much all culturally conservative women) act like they have far less political power and daresay brain power than men. What I mean to suggest is that men would be more civilized, humane, and non-violent if only "their women" would stand up to them and not act like such chauvinist males disguised as sex trafficked females. I find the enterprise to be so ugly and corrosive to the cultural ideals I hold dear that I frequently imagine leading a mass strike in which men stop having sex with women unless those women are professional prostitutes or else with simulators of women (and while using artificial wombs and stem cell technology to perpetuate the species without requiring any woman to get pregnant in order to do so) so that women no longer have an incentive to behave like unprofessional prostitutes. Once those bimbos stop getting rewarded for their pathetic whoring, they will probably want to do something more productive with their time. Otherwise, they are too set in their ways to be treated as anything but severely mentally ill people. (To me those women look ugly rather than sexy. They literally look like clowns sans the humor due to their hideous makeup, gaudy and trashy clothing, and verbal and non verbal language which makes them seem like children in heat dry humping in front of their care givers all while touting themselves as edgy, empowered, and original (but I what I see them as is timid, submissive (to chauvinist brutish males who are likely dumber than even they are), and horrifically unoriginal in their expression).

(As I write this note I hear people (what I assume to be young men) protesting in my vicinity. That is almost always the case whenever I think or do anything which is not about wasting my time waiting for their cue to do something other than procrastinate. It seems like human civilization is being held hostage by and forced to cater primarily to young thuggish men. Sometimes it seems like I am the only human I know to exist who is critical of the uninspired mumble rap or disaffected drone-like mooing which seems to pass for music. I am not against any kind of music being published. I just don't like how other people often play their music loudly and force me to listen to it while those same people seem to protest almost violently at me for simply talking out loud to myself (and not at a particularly loud volume) or getting into something which is not all about catering to "those people" as the only people who seem to matter throughout all human history).

Also, some rude young man (whose phone number had a 510 area code and appeared to be coming from Oakland) called me on the phone at approximately 9PM yesterday just to say, "I don't mean to ruin your evening, but you're fired," and then abruptly hanging up the phone. Also, two days ago while I was at work some woman who was not a manager but just another warehouse associate at my level (but with a longer employment period at the company than what I had since I was merely a new hire) rudely told me, "You have no right to work." The woman was Hispanic/Latino. The man on the phone sounded Black. I have been told by the media that Hispanic/Latino and Black Americans are the most marginalized group of people in the United States of America, but what the mainstream (politically correct) media almost never seems to acknowledge is how such people are largely to blame with their relatively shitty living conditions, low IQs, low incomes, and poor health. Most notably perhaps is how they seem to have disproportionately high birth rates (and mostly unplanned pregnancies) and highest rates of domestic violence, child abuse/neglect, and financial strife. This is not to suggest that systemic racism is not a significant factor in such people being so destitute, brutish, and marginalized. I bet that if children are raised from a young age in more affluent and nurturing conditions, they would perform just as well as their white and Asian peers.

I do not mind being called racist or any other pejorative term. What I do mind is being prevented by other people from working. 

Lastly, I want to confess that I admit to having recurring thoughts (which I do not ever intend to literally implement as actions) about committing violence against those who invade my personal space and taunt me while doing so in ways which I find to be particularly irksome (and those ways seem completely devoid of any humor and take the form of someone practically having a psychotic breakdown in front of me with high blood pressure and desperately trying to taunt me into hitting them). 

It seems that "those people" are vehemently opposed to me being a pacifist and happily minding my own business because such people think I only deserve to be in excruciating physical and/or psychological agony most of the time and such people seem to have an insatiable appetite for endless violence and preventable strife. I think that such people have socially mandated that they be too narcissistic to seriously care about science, environmental sustainability, non human animal welfare, and freedom of speech for all (and not just for people who are sycophants saying only what those people are prepared to hear).

Many people (especially women) have insisted that I only care about keeping my body fat percentage relatively low (for a girl, of course) and that I have nothing else to be preoccupied with. Methinks those vain bitches are accustomed to having too slow of metabolisms and too low of caloric and information intakes to seriously keep up with higher-testosterone people like me and, hence, such testosterone deficient people feel the need to denigrate me (even if they have to create an exaggerated caricature of me in order to do so) so that they can distract themselves from feeling inferior instead of taking measures to correct the deficiencies they notice in themselves but are too lacking in self awareness and courage to take measures towards "correcting" in the manner I have. 

I think it is important to inform the public that I take testosterone for more than just having stronger bones and muscles than I would otherwise. I think the main reason I take testosterone is that it makes me feel more driven to stand up for myself and more viscerally aware of the subtle power dynamics which are always at play in a male dominated society of violence-prone, territorial, and sexist apes. 

<span style="background:#ffff00">So, contrary to popular belief, my <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_3/main/karbytes_testosterone_updates.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testosterone usage</a> is not primarily to alter my aesthetics, but rather, to have fortitude and fighting capabilities which are literally equal to that of a biological man my age.</span> I think that one factoid is one of the most vehemently censored aspects of my life because it threatens the patriarchal status quo so much even (low intelligence) women are compelled to reflexively defend the patriarchy by insisting that I am only taking testosterone to alter my body shape so as to be leaner than I would naturally be. I used to think there was truth to that accusation until I realized that what really made me want to stay on the testosterone more than anything was how it made me feel emotionally (but feeling strong and confident and high in self esteem is mere vanity without the physical and mental fighting power to back it up (which is probably the main reason why many people would rather me just chant affirmations such as "I am enough" and "I am loved" and "I attract good things into my life" while staring at myself in the mirror in dead seriousness while having physical fitness and education levels which are similar to that of the average low income woman in America than take testosterone, read dense nonfiction books about technical subject matter, and exercise regularly)). 

Related to what I said is a thought which has been lingering in my mind during the past 24 hours: capitalism has no brain of its own yet it appears to because it has millions if not billions of humans blindly and compulsively carrying out its agenda to keep it alive even at the expense of humans especially by promoting practices which keep people chronically unwell so that they are most likely to spend money on products and services which are advertised as having the potential to cure whatever their ailments are while that same system discourages people adopting and maintaining habits which keep them healthy, autonomous, and not so dependent on expensive medical and wellness cures and aids. People seem to get very irked just by me adhering to a healthy (mostly organic and mostly vegan) diet and exercising almost daily. I can tell many people would rather me be sleep deprived, out of shape, malnourished, and have much lower brain matter density, bone density, and muscle mass. That's why I have "no friends": too many people act like enemies who want to sabotage my efforts to be successful at what I attempt to accomplish no matter what it is simply because those people have a pervasive and unexamined scarcity mentality which says that there is only a small and finite "amount" of success and wellness to go around (which means that the little stout thick-necked men must go out of their way to force me to inhale their cigarette smoke and be jolted out of sleep or focus by their loud and obnoxious car horns honking).

I am all for genocide against whoever I consider to be my enemies. I do not want to incarcerate nor punish them. I just want to get rid of them and put them out of their misery. They are wasting the gift of life as a human being and trying to waste mine as well. I'm okay if they do not drag other people down with them into their misery spirals, but I do mind when they try to ruin my satisfaction in life merely because they decide their misery needs company. I decided that such people should not be allowed to breed nor impede the livelihoods of those who seriously want to be successful and well (because people who are seriously dedicated to making progress towards their own goals and not at the expense of other people seem to not have a "need" to make other people feel bad).
