Between 12:00AM Pacific Standard Time and 1:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 31_OCTOBER_2023, I uploaded the video file named pig_gorl_30_october_2023.mp4 to the GitHub repository which contains this plain-text note file and discovered that, when I tried to watch that video at the following raw GitHub file link, a new web browser window did not open up displaying solely that video in playback format. Instead what happened was that video file started getting downloaded. I went to the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com and clicked on hyperlinks leading to raw GitHub video files and noticed that the file was downloaded instead of a playback video browswer window opening. Then I saved the URL below to the WayBack Machine as a newly saved web page and saw that the WayBack Machine save of that URL leads to a playback format of that video such that the video can be watched directly on the WayBack Machine without having to download that video onto one's local machine.

I have been writing some "dark" things in journal entries which may or may not be accessible to the public on my blogging website which seem to have finally culminated tonight around 1AM when I got upset enough by someone's behavior towards me who I was Facebook friends with until tonight when I decided to unfriend that person as a way of communicating to that person and to others and to myself that I am not okay with continuing to pretend such behavior does not cause me enough distress to seem disruptive to my ability to function as well as I think I ought to. I do not like being that angry that frequently especially over issues which seem to recur instead of get permanently and satisfactorily resolved. I got tired of having to excuse other people to get away with covertly antagonizing me while I kept it (mostly) a secret for the sake of avoiding further drama and because I take pride in myself as someone who does not get sucked into drama (which tonight's videos of some young man and I getting into a bit of a fight but ultimately neither one of us ended up doing anything to physically hurt the other). I think that if it were not for the personal issue related to the aforementioned Facebook unfriending, I would have simply put on headphones and loud music instead of getting up and demanding that the guy leave merely because he was rapping loudly.

He and I might as well both be living on the street right now. Neither one of us is more deserving of existence. I think it is cool that he is able to have fun out here. I am the one acting high maintenance by insisting that I have my own quiet and private space instead of getting used to being in public all the time and on my own most of the time as an introvert who can live in harmony with almost anyone else around me. Being that comfortable in the presence of others seems like a nice ideal for me to have but, at the same time, a part of me is calling bullshit because that part of me knows that there is no substitute for having a private and adequately furnished enclosure in which to dwell alone for the purpose of enjoying uninterupted solitude and self indulgence.

I am a bit disturbed by some of the violent and misanthropist things I have written recently and how I behaved tonight (i.e. when I picked up that metal chair and threatened to use it as a weapon to stike that guy who was not doing anything to make me feel physically endangered). I think I may have increased my odds significantly that I will get beaten up when I am not suspecting it in public because of my cocky behavior. I admit to acting a lot more confident, street smart, and full of self esteem than what is probably the truth. I found that out tonight and I am now starting to feel comfortable with the idea of dying much younger than I thought I would and being much poorer and much more unpopular (and perhaps marginalized and maligned) than I thought I would be over ten years ago back when I thought I was guarateed to have a life of luxury, prestige, and esteem from many others. I heard that guy and his friend talking about always being under stress. I did not grow up black and poor in a rough part of the Bay Area. Instead, I grew up in a relatively sheltered and well-to-do part of the Bay Area which is known for being home to Nazis. Castro Valley does not seem very white supremacist right now because it seems to be very racially diverse. It is a nice place to live and I think I am definitely a bit spoiled by having spent most of my life there (which is why I feel a bit out of my element outside of Castro Valley). There is no place in the world like that town I grew up in (which has a small town feel and the sense that I was well known throughout the town). Outside of that town I am just another "nobody" just like everyone else seems to be. I am just one of approximately 8 billion humans which currently dwell on Planet Earth. Objectively speaking, no human is more important than any other human. Each human has a measurable impact on society and the universe as a whole.
