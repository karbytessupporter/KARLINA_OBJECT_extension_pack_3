Last night I did a rather large microdose of shrooms and watched some of the best videos I have ever seen beneath a starry night sky strewn with strands of cirrus clouds while wrapped up in a sleeping bag and huddling in my bubble of body heat against the sub 50 degree (Fahrenheit and not Celsius) air temperature (with some light wind introducing the wind chill factor in my experience).

After that, I went to sleep in some "no man's land" garden and had some pleasant and vivid dreams involving me getting into what looked like the start of non sexual bestiality with a yellow Labrador dog.

The next day I drank some cold brew coffee and laid beneath the noon sky (which is, like last night's sky, marbled with cirrus clouds). I saw three red tail hawks enter the airspace above me and glide in circles such that each of the three hawks was traveling in the same rotational direction and each was at a different height above the ground. I referred to those birds as my brethren and as people.

What a person is not is food. What a person is is relative.

(What I meant to imply by the previous sentence was that "person" is an entirely subjective rather than objective classification of objects (especially objects which are objectively classified as information processing agents). What I mean to suggest is that it takes a person to recognize a person. That is because a person is always a figment of some person's imagination).

<span style="background:#ffff00">(I would define a <strong>person</strong> to be an <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> which renders the experience of itself being a relatively changeless object at the epicenter of its own (necessarily subjective) field of awareness as a singular localized "point" (or as a spatially finite network spanning multiple of such "points")).</span>

* * *

Clarification: In the previous section of this note I suggested that only a person recognizes any object as a person. Perhaps there are exceptions which prove that hypothetical rule to be wrong. <span style="background:#ffff00">Perhaps there exists an information processing agent or, even more simply, boundless irreducible consciousness recognizing that some object within its scope of awareness is a person while that scope of awareness appears to all vantages not to be a person).</span>
