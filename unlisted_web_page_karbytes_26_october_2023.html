Within the past 24 hours, karbytes shared the following link on karbytes' Twitter page, on karbytes' Minds page, on karbytes' LinkedIn page, and on karbytes' Patreon page:

<a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/</a>

(karbytes re-shared that web page on karbytes' social media because karbytes made an update to that web page within the past 24 hours; namely, karbytes added commentary to the bottom of the main content section elaborating on the "mission" karbytes distilled in the form of a tweet (to attempt to approximate all of reality inside of a single all-encompassing software model). The most recently appended commentary is arguably more important to karbytes' than is the aforementioned tweet because the commentary (which is about a dream karbytes had within the past 72 hours in which karbytes was able to test out the "immortal technique" of spawning a wormhole which karbytes (and other physical objects and electromagnetic waves) can enter and in order to be transported to a parallel universe before the universe in which the wormhole spawned inside of gives way to entropy) proposes at least a hypothetical way physical and digital artifacts can be preserved for an infinitely long period of time. karbytes is hoping to discover that every person gets infinitely many lives in which to incarnate as some kind of information processing agent (whose continuity of consciousness could potentially be extended for an infinitely long time inside of one lifespan or across infinitely many temporally finite lifespans in succession) localized to some space-time continuum substantiated by reference points of matter and animated by energetic hydraulics. Within the context of such speculation, <span style="background:#ffff00">karbytes always operates according to the aspirational ideal to make the website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> (and every digital artifact which is linked to that website's home page and which karbytes has licensed as being public domain (according to karbytes' own definitions and understanding of intellectual property law and ethics)) immutable and as unconditionally accessible as possible by keeping at least one physical copy of that software's encompassing universe (including the hardware which stores that software as sequences of machine-readable binary digits along with machinery constantly being deployed to generate software runtime instances out of those binary digits) instantiated.</span> It is more literal than metaphorical to suggest that the endeavor which the previous sentence described is akin to storing multiple copies of exactly one data pattern across multiple web servers in case one of those servers malfunctions and hence causes the files it hosts to effectively vanish from the World Wide Web. karbytes thinks that the most stable and long-lasting memories are the patterns of data which take residence across sufficiently large networks whose nodes are solipsistic information processing agents because such pieces of data are, based on historical data gathered from how organisms on Planet Earth evolved and acquired increasingly sophisticated means to increase their lifespans and reproduction opportunities, more likely to have resources invested in maintaining their substrates than are competing pieces of data).

Also within the past 24 hours, karbytes shared the following two links on karbytes' Twitter page and on karbytes' Minds page:

<a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-quantum-computers-will-correct-their-errors-20211116/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-quantum-computers-will-correct-their-errors-20211116/</a>

<a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-create-elusive-particles-that-remember-their-pasts-20230509/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-create-elusive-particles-that-remember-their-pasts-20230509/</a>

(Part of karbytes' agenda is to promote "user friendly" and "high quality" free educational resources via karbytes' personal brand and social media news feeds. The two Quanta Magazine articles which karbytes shared within the past 24 hours on social media help to keep karbytes and other fans of karbtyes inspired, entertained, and informed about subjects which are most prominently featured in karbytes' primary website (i.e. the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com). karbytes intends to spend the remainder of karbytes' lifespan studying metaphysics, physics (especially quantum mechanics and cosmology and photoelectrodynamics), mathematics, computer science, linguistics, and ethology according to karbytes' own dictates for karbytes' own solipsistic (i.e. private) enjoyment and, secondarily, to help make such enjoyment more accessible to persons other than karbytes (and ideally to all persons)).
