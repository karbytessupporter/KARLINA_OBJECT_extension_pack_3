Within 24 hours of publishing the image named instagram_karbytes_26_november_2023.jpg to my Instagram account, I deleted that Instagram post because the printed-out PDF document depicted by that image contained some natural number of semantic errors in the top section of that document (and the name of that PDF document is karlina_object_dot_wordpress_dot_com_home_page_winter_2023.pdf).

Today karbytes decided to fix those errors and re-upload that PDF and its respective plain-text file to the public karbytes-created GitHub repository named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_3.

Also today, karbytes updated the web page named KARLINA_OBJECT_winter_2023_starter_pack_physical_artifacts_inventory of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com to include links to the file named karlina_object_dot_wordpress_dot_com_home_page_winter_2023.pdf and to the file named karlina_object_dot_wordpress_dot_com_home_page_winter_2023.txt.

Within the next 72 hours karbytes expects to print out the updated version of karlina_object_dot_wordpress_dot_com_home_page_winter_2023.pdf and also to close KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_3 to further edits and then burn three M_DISCs with the zip files listed in the file named M_DISCs_burn_list_winter_2023.txt in the aforementioned GitHub repository.
