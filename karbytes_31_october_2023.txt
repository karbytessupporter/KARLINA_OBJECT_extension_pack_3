Between 12:00AM Pacific Standard Time and 1:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 31_OCTOBER_2023, I uploaded the video file named pig_gorl_30_october_2023.mp4 to the GitHub repository which contains this plain-text note file and discovered that, when I tried to watch that video at the following raw GitHub file link, a new web browser window did not open up displaying solely that video in playback format. Instead what happened was that video file started getting downloaded. I went to the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com and clicked on hyperlinks leading to raw GitHub video files and noticed that the file was downloaded instead of a playback video browswer window opening. Then I saved the URL below to the WayBack Machine as a newly saved web page and saw that the WayBack Machine save of that URL leads to a playback format of that video such that the video can be watched directly on the WayBack Machine without having to download that video onto one's local machine.
