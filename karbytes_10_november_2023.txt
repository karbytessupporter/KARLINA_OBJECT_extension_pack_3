Last night I did a rather large microdose of shrooms and watched some of the best videos I have ever seen beneath a starry night sky strewn with strands of cirrus clouds while wrapped up in a sleeping bag and huddling in my bubble of body heat against the sub 50 degree (Fahrenheit and not Celsius) air temperature (with some light wind introducing the wind chill factor in my experience).

After that, I went to sleep in some "no man's land" garden and had some pleasant and vivid dreams involving me getting into what looked like the start of non sexual bestiality with a yellow Labrador dog.

The next day I drank some cold brew coffee and laid beneath the noon sky (which is, like last night's sky, marbled with cirrus clouds). I saw three red tail hawks enter the airspace above me and glide in circles such that each of the three hawks was traveling in the same rotational direction and each was at a different height above the ground. I referred to those birds as my brethren and as people.

What a person is not is food. What a person is is relative.

(What I meant to imply by the previous sentence was that "person" is an entirely subjective rather than objective classification of objects (especially objects which are objectively classified as information processing agents). What I mean to suggest is that it takes a person to recognize a person. That is because a person is always a figment of some person's imagination).

(I would define a person to be an information processing agent which renders the experience of itself being a relatively changeless object at the epicenter of its own (necessarily subjective) field of awareness as a singular localized "point" (or as a spatially finite network spanning multiple of such "points")).

Clarification: In the previous section of this note I suggested that only a person recognizes any object as a person. Perhaps there are exceptions which prove that hypothetical rule to be wrong. Perhaps there exists an information processing agent or, even more simply, boundless irreducible consciousness recognizing that some object within its scope of awareness is a person while that scope of awareness appears to all vantages not to be a person).

Lastly, I felt the need to officially (in the form of permanently public documentation) state my intent to never again attempt to contact via telecommunications, snail mail, or "in person" interaction Alan Jason Ponte. I think that he may have been waiting for me to officially declare our involvement in each other's lives over. Also I think the public ought to know that it is my intention to be a loner for the rest of my existence (while sometimes allotting finite and brief amounts of time to socializing and interacting with other people in a way which is mutually desired instead of intentionally forced on any party of that interpersonal "busy-ness").

I posted the following paragraph as a tweet on my Twitter dot Com page and then deleted that tweet within three minutes of publishing it:

My second biggest fear is being prevented against my will from pursuing trains of thought or behavior which I consider to be essential to making sufficient progress towards my self-assigned goals.

The paragraph above is not as significant and as impactful to me as is the related tweet which I published on my Twitter dot Com page yesterday whose plain-text content is identical to the following paragraph:

My biggest fear is intense physical pain (especially if it is what I deem to be gory and what I deem to be prolonged in terms of temporal duration and what I deem to be excessively frequent).
