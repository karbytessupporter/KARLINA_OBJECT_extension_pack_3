In order for one person to have nice things, some other person has to be deprived of those nice things.

P: "Of course people are trying to make Karlina have a nervous breakdown in public as a means to eject Karlina from the public sphere. We expect Karlina to have to be institutionalized for acting out in ways which are deemed to be threatening to public safety or to Kar's own safety. We do not think it is good for Kar to be so intensely devoted to some project. We want Karlina to be prevented from doing anything physically or intellectually challenging so that Kar conforms to what the public seems to prefer Karlina to be: too uptight to do anything but take offense and engage in self sabotage for the public's amusement and to punish Karlina for offending us."

Q: "Why would karbytes engage in self sabotage as a result of not being allowed by people other than karbytes to take on endeavors which those people think are physically or intellectually challenging?"

P: "Karlina engaging in such endeavors would eventually give her a sense of accomplishment and hence a sense of feeling good, in control, and making progress towards something of value. We think Karlina has committed too many unforgivable transgressions and has a personality no one except for Karlina seems to condone taking residence in the world for us to want to allow to have self esteem, freedom, competence, and being liked and supported in being successful and happy by other people. Instead, we want Karlina to think that no one except for Karlina wants Karlina to attain those niceties. Such things are not unconditional rights. Instead, they are privileges which can be revoked as a consequence of committing some unforgivable transgression. We do not like the character Karlina is trying to portray herself as to herself and others and want her to be coerced into embodying a character which is much more histrionic, humorless, irritable, wounded, panicky, and deeply dissatisfied."

In yesterday's journal entry when I said that I intend to abstain from having intimate relationships with other humans until I think that sufficiently many humans in my environment are not gender obsessed, what I really meant to say was when sufficiently many humans are not so deliberately and stubbornly intrusive of my personal space, antagonistic, and controlling. Right now I see too many humans lording over others (especially me (especially in passive aggressive and conflict escalating ways)) instead of focusing on getting tasks done which do not require a captive audience to observe and give feedback (especially the affirmative variety). 

Related to that is me seriously wanting to implementing a new policy of deliberately withholding all compliments, words of encouragement, and gratitude from all humans. I anticipate a human trying to fish for such favoritist and supplicating treatment from me only to find I am coldly impersonal, not at all easily impressed, and very forthcoming with criticism. I could even say flippantly that they might need to imagine Jesus is real and cares about them because they lack redeeming qualities other than being the product of God.
