I am getting ready to burn the Winter 2023 M_DISCs soon. (For more details about that, see the web page named KARLINA_OBJECT_winter_2023_starter_pack_physical_artifacts_inventory of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com). 

Today I went to an Office Depot store to print out the file named karlina_object_dot_wordpress_dot_com_home_page_winter_2023.pdf.

Approximately five hours later, I realized that I made a semantics error in that document and that document's respective ".txt" file.
