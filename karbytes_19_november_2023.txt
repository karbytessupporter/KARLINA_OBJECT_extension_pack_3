I was waiting until 19_NOVEMBER_2023 since yesterday to write a note like this one (because I did not want this note's relatively "low brow" content to detract from the slightly less "low brow" content which I published yesterday in the plain-text file named karbytes_18_november_2023.txt).

(Besides publishing the plain-text file named karbytes_19_november_2023.txt today, I also published video files named pig_gorl_19_november_2023_part_0.mp4, pig_gorl_19_november_2023_part_1.mp4, and pig_gorl_19_november_2023_part_2.mp4).

What I wanted to say in karbytes_19_november_2023.txt which I did not say in karbytes_18_november_2023.txt is the following two things:

(0) I redact what I said about men generally treating me better than women. Depending on which information is occupying the most space in my working memory at a particular moment in time, I might be inclined to reflexively conclude that (a) men are crueler to me than women are or (b) that men women are crueler to me than men are or (c) that men and women are roughly equal in terms of how cruel they are to me.

(1) If any person engages in ongoing behavior which is what I consider to be seriously detrimental to my quality of life for a sufficiently long time, I would not hesitate to have that person quickly killed (but only if I am sufficiently confident that my voting to have that person killed would not result in anything bad happening to me as a result of people wanting to retaliate against me for exterminating a particular person).

To elaborate on the first of those two things, I think I generally feel more contempt towards women than towards men because I think that women tend to default to enabling the men in their lives to get away with being tyrannical and belligerent due to those women being conditioned to assume a very passive and dumbed down role compared to their male counterparts (and I think that trend is most prominent amongst Black and Hispanic/Latino populations and probably the least prominent amongst the comparatively egalitarian and liberal (rather than culturally conservative) white (notice the lack of capitalization) populations). The pig_gorl recordings I made are my attempts to imitate the vocal qualities I find most abhorent about culturally conservative and/or under-educated women. They sound like cucks to the patriarchy who normalize being weaker, stupider, and less vibrant than they otherwise could be despite comprising approximately half the human population and having the same legal rights as men. Despite the fact that women are treated as having equal rights as men by law, the vast majority of women (and pretty much all culturally conservative women) act like they have far less political power and daresay brain power than men. What I mean to suggest is that men would be more civilized, humane, and non-violent if only "their women" would stand up to them and not act like such chauvinist males disguised as sex trafficked females. I find the enterprise to be so ugly and corrosive to the cultural ideals I hold dear that I frequently imagine leading a mass strike in which men stop having sex with women unless those women are professional prostitutes or else with simulators of women (and while using artificial wombs and stem cell technology to perpetuate the species without requiring any woman to get pregnant in order to do so) so that women no longer have an incentive to behave like unprofessional prostitutes. Once those bimbos stop getting rewarded for their pathetic whoring, they will probably want to do something more productive with their time. Otherwise, they are too set in their ways to be treated as anything but severely mentally ill people. (To me those women look ugly rather than sexy. They literally look like clowns sans the humor due to their hideous makeup, gaudy and trashy clothing, and verbal and non verbal language which makes them seem like children in heat dry humping in front of their care givers all while touting themselves as edgy, empowered, and original (but I what I see them as is timid, submissive (to chauvinist brutish males who are likely dumber than even they are), and horrifically unoriginal in their expression).

(As I write this note I hear people (what I assume to be young men) protesting in my vicinity. That is almost always the case whenever I think or do anything which is not about wasting my time waiting for their cue to do something other than procrastinate. It seems like human civilization is being held hostage by and forced to cater primarily to young thuggish men. Sometimes it seems like I am the only human I know to exist who is critical of the uninspired mumble rap or disaffected drone-like mooing which seems to pass for music. I am not against any kind of music being published. I just don't like how other people often play their music loudly and force me to listen to it while those same people seem to protest almost violently at me for simply talking out loud to myself (and not at a particularly loud volume) or getting into something which is not all about catering to "those people" as the only people who seem to matter throughout all human history).

Also, some rude young man (whose phone number had a 510 area code and appeared to be coming from Oakland) called me on the phone at approximately 9PM yesterday just to say, "I don't mean to ruin your evening, but you're fired," and then abruptly hanging up the phone. Also, two days ago while I was at work some woman who was not a manager but just another warehouse associate at my level (but with a longer employment period at the company than what I had since I was merely a new hire) rudely told me, "You have no right to work." The woman was Hispanic/Latino. The man on the phone sounded Black. I have been told by the media that Hispanic/Latino and Black Americans are the most marginalized group of people in the United States of America, but what the mainstream (politically correct) media almost never seems to acknowledge is how such people are largely to blame with their relatively shitty living conditions, low IQs, low incomes, and poor health. Most notably perhaps is how they seem to have disproportionately high birth rates (and mostly unplanned pregnancies) and highest rates of domestic violence, child abuse/neglect, and financial strife. This is not to suggest that systemic racism is not a significant factor in such people being so destitute, brutish, and marginalized. I bet that if children are raised from a young age in more affluent and nurturing conditions, they would perform just as well as their white and Asian peers.

I do not mind being called racist or any other pejorative term. What I do mind is being prevented by other people from working. 

Lastly, I want to confess that I admit to having recurring thoughts (which I do not ever intend to literally implement as actions) about committing violence against those who invade my personal space and taunt me while doing so in ways which I find to be particularly irksome (and those ways seem completely devoid of any humor and take the form of someone practically having a psychotic breakdown in front of me with high blood pressure and desperately trying to taunt me into hitting them). 

It seems that "those people" are vehemently opposed to me being a pacifist and happily minding my own business because such people think I only deserve to be in excruciating physical and/or psychological agony most of the time and such people seem to have an insatiable appetite for endless violence and preventable strife. I think that such people have socially mandated that they be too narcissistic to seriously care about science, environmental sustainability, non human animal welfare, and freedom of speech for all (and not just for people who are sycophants saying only what those people are prepared to hear).
